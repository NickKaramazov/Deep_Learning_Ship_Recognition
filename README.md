# Deep_Learning_Ship_Recognition
Ship Recognition with Neural Networks 

In this project we will be using Datasets from Kaggle with images of ships and images of sea/coastal areas without ships.

The aim is to learn how to tweak the structure of a neural network in order to boost our performance.

We will start with the following dataset:

And time allowing will move on to the more complicated Airbus dataset:
